# Release Notes: Metrics Manager

<!--## Version 2026.2.0-->

<!--date TBD-->

## Version 2026.1.0

**Release Date:** May 11, 2026

**New:**

- **Server-Sent Events (SSE) Streaming** — New `/metrics/stream` endpoint streams all metrics (system + custom) in real-time via SSE. Each connected client polls the Telegraf Prometheus endpoint independently. Browser requests receive a live HTML table; SSE clients receive raw event stream
  - **Impact**: Dashboards can now consume metrics without polling, enabling real-time visualizations. Replaces the old WebSocket relay model

- **Multiple Input Formats** — Accept custom metrics in four formats without code changes:
  - JSON Batch (`POST /api/v1/metrics`) — multiple metrics with multiple fields
  - Simple JSON (`POST /api/v1/metrics/simple`) — single metric, simplest format
  - InfluxDB Line Protocol (`POST /api/v1/metrics/influx`) — standard Influx format
  - OpenTelemetry (OTLP) (`POST /api/v1/metrics/otlp`) — CNCF standard format
  - **Impact**: Any monitoring system can integrate without client library or format conversion

- **Intel NPU Telemetry** — Bundled `npu_reader.py` script collects metrics from Intel NPU:
  - Power draw (watts)
  - Frequency, temperature, utilization
  - Memory usage, bandwidth, tile configuration
  - Supported on Meteor Lake (MTL), Arrow Lake (ARL), Lunar Lake (LNL), Panther Lake (PTL)
  - **Impact**: Full hardware observability for edge AI applications on Intel platforms

- **Custom Metrics Scripts** — Drop executable scripts into `/app/custom-metrics/` (shell or Python). Telegraf runs them every 10 seconds and publishes metrics automatically
  - **Impact**: No REST API calls needed for custom metrics. Simplest way to add application-specific metrics

- **Docker Compose & Kubernetes** — Production-ready `compose.yaml` and Helm chart included
  - Docker Compose for standalone deployments
  - Helm chart published to OCI registry (`oci://registry-1.docker.io/intel/metrics-manager:2026.1.0-helm`)
  - **Impact**: Deploy in 3 commands on Docker or Kubernetes

- **Comprehensive API Reference** — Health checks, statistics, detailed endpoint documentation
  - Basic health (`GET /health`)
  - Detailed health with store statistics (`GET /api/health`)
  - Service statistics (`GET /api/v1/stats`)
  - **Impact**: Easy to integrate into monitoring systems and dashboards

**Improved:**

- **Debounced Persistence** — Custom metrics are persisted to Telegraf with configurable debounce (default 100ms). Prevents HTTP bottleneck when ingesting high-frequency metrics
  - **Impact**: Support for 1000+ metrics per second without API latency spikes

- **Memory Protection** — Automatic eviction of oldest metrics when in-memory limit is reached (default 100k metrics)
  - **Impact**: Metrics service can't run out of memory even under sustained high ingestion

- **Structured Logging** — JSON-formatted logs by default (with human-readable text option for development)
  - **Impact**: Easy integration with log aggregators (ELK, Datadog, etc.)

- **Rate Limiting** — Per-IP token bucket rate limiting (default 1000 requests/minute per IP)
  - **Impact**: Protection against accidental/malicious floods; health and statistics endpoints exempt

- **Correlation IDs** — Every request gets a correlation ID (auto-generated UUID or from `X-Correlation-ID` header) for distributed tracing
  - **Impact**: Easy to track requests through logs and multiple services

- **GZIP Compression** — Automatic compression for HTTP responses >1 KB
  - **Impact**: Reduced bandwidth for metrics streaming (especially important for SSE)

**Known Issues:**

None at this release. See GitHub issues for feature requests and discussions.

## Version 2026.0.1

**Release Date:** May 5, 2026

**Fixed:**

- **SSE Stream HTML UI** — Browser requests to `/metrics/stream` now receive an HTML page with an in-place updated metrics table (previously showed raw SSE stream)
  - **Impact**: Live dashboard experience in browser without client-side framework

- **Content Negotiation** — `/metrics/stream` auto-detects client type:
  - Browser (`Accept: text/html`) → HTML page
  - SSE client (`Accept: text/event-stream`) → raw stream
  - **Impact**: Single endpoint works for both browsers and programmatic clients

## Version 2026.0.0

**Release Date:** April 1, 2026

**New:**

- **Initial Release** — Metrics Manager with:
  - Telegraf-based system metrics collection (CPU, RAM, temperature, GPU, NPU)
  - FastAPI REST interface for custom metrics ingestion
  - In-memory metrics store with configurable retention
  - Prometheus-compatible output (`GET /metrics`, `:9273/metrics`)
  - Real-time SSE streaming (`GET /metrics/stream`)

---

## Versions and Dependencies

### Current Image

- Intel® Metrics Manager **2026.1.0**
- Telegraf **1.37.3** (system metrics agent)
- qmassa **1.3.1** (Intel® GPU telemetry via named pipe)
- qmmd **0.1.1** _(optional)_ — Lightweight Prometheus GPU exporter (bundled but **not started by default**; use only if you need a separate GPU metrics port)
- Intel® NPU telemetry via bundled `npu_monitor_tool` / `npu_reader`
- Python **3.12** runtime + FastAPI service
- supervisord process supervisor

> **Note on qmmd:** The default Metrics Manager already collects GPU metrics via `qmassa_reader.py` and Telegraf. Enable qmmd only if you need a standalone Prometheus exporter on a separate port. See [Environment Variables](./get-started/environment-variables.md#optional-components) for details.

## Migration Guide

### From Version 2026.0.x to 2026.1.0

No breaking changes. All existing endpoints remain compatible.

**What changed:**

- SSE stream now returns flat metric format instead of measurement/field split
- Content negotiation added for `/metrics/stream` (HTML vs SSE)

**Migration steps:**

1. Pull new image: `docker pull intel/metrics-manager:2026.1.0`
2. Update `docker-compose.yaml` or Helm values if pinning version
3. Restart: `docker compose up -d`
4. No data migration needed (in-memory store)
