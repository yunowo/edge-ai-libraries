# Text To Speech Microservice

This repository provides a FastAPI-based microservice for text-to-speech
generation with OpenVINO and PyTorch runtime support. It accepts text input,
synthesizes speech with the configured TTS model, and returns either raw WAV
audio or JSON metadata plus a base64-encoded WAV payload.

Below, you'll find links to detailed documentation to help you get started,
configure, and deploy the microservice.

  during startup.
