# Quick Start Guide

- **Time to Complete:** 10 mins
- **Programming Language:** Python

Get the Inference Router running with one configured backend and verify the
OpenAI-compatible API.

## Get Started

### Prerequisites

- Install Docker 25.0 or higher: [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).
- Python 3.10+ for local development.
- An OpenAI-compatible inference backend, such as vLLM, reachable from this
  host, or an API key for a cloud provider supported by LiteLLM.

The router itself is lightweight. Local model serving requirements depend on
the backend you connect to.

If you are cloning from the larger monorepo and only need this service, you
can use sparse checkout:

```bash
git clone --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries.git
cd edge-ai-libraries
git sparse-checkout set microservices/inference-router
cd microservices/inference-router
```

### Step 1: Configure

Copy the example config and edit it to point at your backend. Note that the backend service **must be alive beforehand**. If your provider
needs API keys, also copy `.env.example` to `workspace/.env` and fill in the
applicable values:

```bash
mkdir -p workspace
cp config.example.yaml workspace/config.yaml
cp .env.example workspace/.env
```

A minimal `workspace/config.yaml` with one local vLLM model:

```yaml
providers:
  - name: "local"
    type: "hosted_vllm"
    model: "Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B"
    enabled: true
    metadata:
      labels:
        - "local"
      cost: 0
      performance: 0.85
      capability:
        complexity: 0.75
    settings:
      endpoint: "http://localhost:8088/v1"
      timeout: 300.0
      auth:
        scheme: "none"
        api_key: null
        custom_headers: {}
```

The router uses [LiteLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/#litellm-python-sdk) to
support different provider backends. `type` is passed to LiteLLM as the prefix
in `type/model`. Use `hosted_vllm` for a self-hosted vLLM server, or any other
[LiteLLM-supported provider](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers).

When `workspace/config.yaml` references values such as `${OPENAI_API_KEY}` or
`${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}`, Docker Compose forwards them from `workspace/.env`
into the container.


#### Model preparation
Docker Compose deployments require the OpenVINO model prepared
**before starting the router**. The currently supported intelligent routing classifier model is
`Qwen3.5-2B-FP16`.

Download the supported Qwen3.5 2B OpenVINO model. If your
environment uses an internal model mirror or an approved local checkpoint,
replace `Qwen/Qwen3.5-2B` with that equivalent source:

```bash
# install huggingface CLI
pip install -U huggingface_hub
```

```bash
hf download OpenVINO/Qwen3.5-2B-fp16-ov --local-dir /opt/models/Qwen2.5-2B-FP16
```

> ⚠️ **`/opt` permissions:** the default `/opt/models` is typically root-owned.
> Grant your user access
> (`sudo mkdir -p /opt/models && sudo chown "$USER:$USER" /opt/models`)

> For PRC users, you might need to set `export HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com`

For Docker Compose deployments, export the model path on this host with
`IR_OV_MODEL`; the compose file mounts it into the container automatically.

```bash
export IR_OV_MODEL=/opt/models/Qwen3.5-2B-FP16
```

### Step 2: Build Image

Build the Docker image:

```bash
bash scripts/deploy_docker.sh --build
```

### Step 3: Deploy

Start the router on port `8000` by default:

```bash
bash scripts/deploy_docker.sh
```

Check that the container is running:

```bash
docker ps --filter name=inference-router
```

To stop the router:

```bash
bash scripts/deploy_docker.sh --down
```

To use a different host port:

```bash
ROUTER_PORT=9000 bash scripts/deploy_docker.sh
```

### Step 4: Verify

List available models. The response includes `router` plus your configured
providers:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/models
```

Send a request to a specific model from `/v1/models`:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hello"}]
  }'
```

<details>
<summary>Tips</summary>

To get a quicker response, you can try to disable `thinking` mode. Different model serving backends may require different way to do that. As an example, for vLLM with Qwen3 model, disable `thinking` with

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hello"}],
    "chat_template_kwargs": {
        "enable_thinking": false
    }
  }'
```

</details>

Let the router pick the provider based on the configured policy:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "auto",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hello"}]
  }'
```

When two providers expose the same model name, `request.model` resolves to
the first one in `config.yaml`. To target the other, pass the provider name
(the `owned_by` field in `/v1/models`) as `model`:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "cloud",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hello"}]
  }'
```

Stream a chat completion:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hello"}],
    "stream": true
  }'
```

View router metrics:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/metrics
```

## Optional: Pass-through Services

Besides chat completions, the router can expose additional OpenAI/Cohere-compatible
endpoints that **forward the request body verbatim** to a backing service and
return the response untouched. These are configured as **providers** — the same
`providers:` list as chat backends — so they are listed, enabled/disabled, and
updated through the same [provider config API](./api-reference.md).

Currently supported services (the provider `type` selects the service and the
endpoint it exposes):

| Provider `type` | Endpoint exposed              | Typical backend                  |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `transcription` | `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions` | Speech-to-text (e.g. Whisper)  |
| `tts`           | `POST /v1/audio/speech`         | Text-to-speech                 |
| `embeddings`    | `POST /v1/embeddings`           | Embedding model                |
| `rerank`        | `POST /v1/rerank`               | Reranker (Cohere-compatible)   |
| `ocr`           | `POST /v1/ocr`                  | OCR / document understanding   |

### Enable a pass-through service

Add a provider whose `type` is one of the values above. The request is forwarded
to `settings.endpoint`; if the endpoint is a base URL, the service subpath (e.g.
`/v1/ocr`) is appended automatically. `model` is a nominal identifier used for
display. There is no `enabled` field to add — a provider present in the config is
enabled (set `enabled: false` to keep it in the file but turn it off).

```yaml
providers:
  # ... your chat providers ...

  - name: "ocr-backend"
    type: "ocr"                       # exposes POST /v1/ocr
    model: "ocr"
    settings:
      endpoint: "http://localhost:8002"
      timeout: 600                    # OCR cold-start + multi-page docs can be slow
      auth:                           # optional; same shape as chat providers
        scheme: "none"

  - name: "embeddings-backend"
    type: "embeddings"                # exposes POST /v1/embeddings
    model: "bge-m3"
    settings:
      endpoint: "http://localhost:9002"
      timeout: 30
```

Then call the endpoint directly (the body and response are passed through as-is):

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/ocr \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"image_path": "/data/page.png"}'

curl http://localhost:8000/v1/embeddings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "bge-m3", "input": "hello world"}'
```

Notes:

- **Not listed in `/v1/models`.** Pass-through backends are not chat-capable
  models, so they are omitted from `/v1/models`. They still appear in
  `/v1/providers` and can be managed there.
- **Concurrency.** Requests to these endpoints count against `max-concurrency`,
  shared with `/v1/chat/completions` — when the limit is reached the router
  returns `429`. Status/config endpoints (`/health`, `/v1/models`, `/v1/config`)
  are never limited.
- **Dynamic control.** Because they are ordinary providers, you can enable,
  disable, update, or delete them at runtime through the `/v1/providers` API; the
  change takes effect immediately. Disabling or removing the provider makes its
  endpoint return `503`.
- The backing services are **not** part of the router — deploy them separately.

## Optional: Compression Plugins

The router can compress prompts before they reach the backend to cut token
usage, via optional plugins based on
[adaptive-token-compressor](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries/tree/main/libraries/adaptive-token-compressor).
Use the unified `compressor` node and select the compressor kind with
`settings.type`:

- `tool` — filters the request `tools` schema to a relevant subset using a
  **tool predictor** (an OpenAI-compatible LLM endpoint).
- `harness` — compresses system/developer messages using a **Lingua server**.


The router image already includes the compressor library (installed
by `scripts/build_docker.sh` at build time).

These backend services are **not** part of the router. For how to deploy
the Lingua server and the tool predictor,
see the
[adaptive-token-compressor](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries/tree/main/libraries/adaptive-token-compressor)
repository. 
For detailed purpose and behavior of each compressor, see the
[adaptive-token-compressor](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries/tree/main/libraries/adaptive-token-compressor) repository documentation.


### Configuration

Enable the plugins under `plugins` in `workspace/config.yaml`, pointing each at
your running services:

Plugin stages:

- `prerouting`: runs before provider selection (routing decision).
- `postrouting`: runs after provider selection and before the backend call.
- `postresponse`: runs on the response after backend inference.

For compressor plugins, define them only in `prerouting` or `postrouting`.
`postresponse` is not for request compression.

In each plugin entry, `node` must be one of the supported fixed values
(currently `compressor`). `settings.type` selects the compressor kind
(`tool` or `harness`). `name` is only an instance identifier and can be any
unique string.

```yaml
plugins:
  prerouting:
    - name: "compressor_tool"
      node: "compressor"
      enabled: true
      settings:
        type: "tool"
        predictor_url: "http://localhost:8088/v1/chat/completions"
        predictor_model: "Qwen/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B"
        score_threshold: 2.0
        prompt_mode: "dynamic"
        tool_descriptions_mode: "dynamic"
        placement: "schema"
  postrouting:
    - name: "compressor_harness"
      node: "compressor"
      enabled: true
      settings:
        type: "harness"
        profile: "openclaw"
        lingua_url: "http://localhost:8001/compress"
        compress_rate: 0.5
        compress_min_chars: 200
        timeout: 60.0
        enable_quantum_lock: false
  postresponse: []
```

### Metrics checking

Compressor-related metrics are exposed from two endpoints:
After sending chat requests, view aggregated compression metrics by

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/plugins/compressor
```

To compare token usage before and after router plugin processing (overall
compressor effect), use:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/metrics
```


### 1) `/v1/plugins/compressor` (node-level compression metrics)

This endpoint returns the `compressor` node view, including metrics aggregated
by the shared `CompressionManager`:

- `metrics`: numeric aggregates.
- `cache_stats`: per-compressor cache usage.

The `metrics` object usually contains:

- `<plugin_name>.total_input`: sum of input tokens before this plugin's compression.
- `<plugin_name>.total_output`: sum of output tokens after this plugin's compression.
- `<plugin_name>.call_count`: number of times this plugin ran.
- `<plugin_name>.compression_ratio`: `total_output / total_input` for this plugin.
  Lower means stronger compression.
- `<plugin_name>.avg_duration_per_call`: average plugin latency in milliseconds.

It also includes cross-plugin overall fields:

- `overall.total_requests`: unique request count across compressor plugins.
- `overall.total_input`: summed input tokens across all compressor plugins.
- `overall.total_output`: summed output tokens across all compressor plugins.
- `overall.compression_ratio`: `overall.total_output / overall.total_input`.
- `overall.avg_duration_per_request`: average end-to-end compression time per request.

`cache_stats` is keyed by plugin name:

- `<plugin_name>.currsize`: current cache entry count.
- `<plugin_name>.maxsize`: configured cache capacity.

This endpoint returns the node metadata plus empty metrics when no compressor
plugin is configured, or when compressor metrics are not available yet (for
example before any request flows through the compressor pipeline).

### 2) `/v1/metrics` (router telemetry with compression effect)

This endpoint includes compressor effect under `token_metrics`:

- `token_metrics.before_router`: token counts before plugin processing.
- `token_metrics.after_router`: token counts after plugin processing.

> **Note**
> `after_router` is measured after `prerouting` and `postrouting` are both
> completed (it is the request that will be forwarded to the backend).

Each of the above contains:

- `system_prompt_tokens`: system + developer message tokens.
- `tool_schema_tokens`: `request.tools` schema tokens.
- `context_tokens`: all other message tokens (user / assistant / tool).
- `overall_tokens`: sum of the three categories.

How to interpret compression savings:

- Per category saving = `before_router.<x> - after_router.<x>`.
- Overall saving = `before_router.overall_tokens - after_router.overall_tokens`.
- Overall remaining ratio = `after_router.overall_tokens / before_router.overall_tokens`.

Unlike provider-reported prompt tokens, `before_router` and `after_router`
here are counted with the same token accounting method, so they are directly
comparable.

### 3) `/v1/plugins/{node}/{name}` (per-instance view)

Beyond the group-aggregated compression view above, any plugin may fold its
**own** runtime info (including metrics) into its instance view. Fetch it with:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/plugins/<node>/<name>
```

The response is whatever the plugin's `describe()` hook returns — the instance
config plus any plugin-defined fields (e.g. a `metrics` object). Plugins that
support it can reset their per-instance state:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/plugins/<node>/<name>/reset
```

There is also a node-level pair: `GET /v1/plugins/<node>` (the type's
`describe_node()` payload, which may carry cross-instance aggregates) and
`POST /v1/plugins/<node>/reset`. See the
[API Reference](./api-reference.md#get-plugin) for the full contract.

Registering your own plugin type and the full list of built-in plugins are
