"""v1 pass-through endpoints.

One POST route is generated per entry in ``PASSTHROUGH_SERVICES`` (the registry
in :mod:`src.providers.passthrough_provider`). Each route forwards the request
verbatim to the pass-through provider configured for that service and returns
its response untouched — audio transcription/speech, embeddings, rerank, OCR.

The backing provider is looked up per-request from the live orchestrator
(``app.state.router``), so enabling/disabling a provider via the ``/v1/providers``
API takes effect immediately (absent → 503). All routes are gated by
``concurrency_guard`` so they share the global ``max_concurrency`` limit with
``/v1/chat/completions``. Adding a new service kind is a single registry entry —
this module needs no change.
