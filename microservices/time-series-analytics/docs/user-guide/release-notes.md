## Version 2026.1

**Release Date:** June 17, 2026

**New:**

- Support for optional CPU core-pinning enabled with the `CORE_PINNING`

  (E-cores, P-cores, or low-power cores).

  packages as tar archives via HTTP. The UDF updates do not require manual
  placement of files.

- Updated the Kapacitor and Python library dependency versions.
