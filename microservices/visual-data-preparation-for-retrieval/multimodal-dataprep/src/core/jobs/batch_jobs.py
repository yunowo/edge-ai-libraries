"""In-process asynchronous batch-job engine for video ingestion.

All batch ingestion surfaces (multi-file upload, batch-process-existing, and
directory ingest) converge onto this single engine. A submitted job owns a list
of :class:`BatchItem` records and is processed **sequentially** on a background
daemon thread, wrapping the same proven single-video processing path used by the
non-batch endpoints. Each item is isolated: a failure records an error on that
item and processing continues with the next one.

The engine is deliberately in-process (a registry ``dict`` guarded by a lock).
Job state is therefore lost on restart, which is acceptable for the current
scope; persistence can be layered on later without changing the public surface.
