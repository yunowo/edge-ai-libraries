# Agent Quality Handler

The Agent Quality Handler is a standalone, configuration-driven service that runs an Agentic Predictive Maintenance graph against detections from a required external storage API.

## Capabilities

- Policy, Analysis, Evidence, and Ticketing agents
- Rule-based fallback mode or profile-gated LLM mode
- MQTT detection ingestion, including authenticated connections to external brokers
- Custom use-case config and prompt mounts
- Direct REST API and Prometheus metrics on port `5002`
- Explicit graph errors with preserved partial results

Detection Service and storage are external. The default Compose deployment
includes the agent and a private MQTT broker; the `llm` profile adds OVMS and
model download. It does not include a UI or Nginx.
