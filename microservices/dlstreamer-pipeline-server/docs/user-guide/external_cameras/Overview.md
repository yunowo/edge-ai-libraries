<!-- ### GenICam GigE or USB3 Cameras
Refer to the [doc](../detailed_usage/camera/genicam.md) for configuration details on GigE/USB3 cameras.

### USB v4l2 Cameras
Refer to the [doc](../detailed_usage/camera/usb.md) for configuration details on the USB cameras. To dynamically specify the USB source via REST request, refer to this [section](../rest_api/customizing_pipeline_requests.md#web-camera-source). -->
