# Stream Frames over WebRTC

DL Streamer Pipeline Server supports streaming the frames over WebRTC protocol using a MediaMTX media server.
There is a dedicated docker compose file for demonstrating WebRTC streaming for DL Streamer Pipeline Server. It is available in DL Streamer Pipeline Server's github repository, under the "docker" folder i.e., `[WORKDIR]/edge-ai-libraries/microservices/dlstreamer-pipeline-server/docker/docker-compose-mediamtx.yml`

Once a pipeline is started, DL Streamer Pipeline Server sends a stream of images through WebRTC protocol to WebRTC browser client. This is done via the MediaMTX server used for signaling.

> **Note:** As an optional recommendation, coturn server can be used to facilitate NAT traversal
> and ensure that the WebRTC stream is accessible on a non-native browser client and helps in
> cases where firewall is enabled. See example usage of coturn server in WebRTC streaming

Below are the necessary configuration to be aware of (or modify accordingly based on your deployment) in `[WORKDIR]/edge-ai-libraries/microservices/dlstreamer-pipeline-server/docker/.env` (They will be consumed appropriately in `[WORKDIR]/edge-ai-libraries/microservices/dlstreamer-pipeline-server/docker/docker-compose-mediamtx.yml`):
```sh
WHIP_SERVER_IP=<HOST_IP> # It should be the IP address of the machine on which an open MediaMTX container is running.
WHIP_SERVER_PORT=8889 # It is the port which is configured for the MediaMTX server. Default port is 8889.
```

To run it on GPU/NPU you must first grant the container user access to GPU/NPU device(s).Because Docker Compose does not evaluate shell expressions, you need to determine the `render` group ID on the host system and define/export it as an environment variable **before** running Docker Compose. You can add group ID in `[WORKDIR]/edge-ai-libraries/microservices/dlstreamer-pipeline-server/docker/.env` or export it using below command:

  ```sh
  export RENDER_GID=$(stat -c "%g" /dev/dri/render* | head -1)
  ```

After setting all the above information, we can start the WebRTC streaming:
- Start the services
    ```sh
        docker compose -f docker-compose-mediamtx.yml up
    ```
- Open another terminal and start a pipeline in DL Streamer Pipeline Server with the below curl command.
    ```sh
        curl http://localhost:8080/pipelines/user_defined_pipelines/pallet_defect_detection -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
        "source": {
            "uri": "file:///home/pipeline-server/resources/videos/warehouse.avi",
            "type": "uri"
        },
        "destination": {
            "metadata": {
                "type": "file",
                "path": "/tmp/results.jsonl",
                "format": "json-lines"
            },
            "frame": {
                "type": "webrtc",
                "peer-id": "pallet-defect-detection"
            }
        },
        "parameters": {
            "detection-properties": {
                "model": "/home/pipeline-server/resources/models/geti/pallet_defect_detection/deployment/Detection/model/model.xml",
                "device": "CPU"
            }
        }
    }'
    ```
- Open `http://<HOST_IP>:8889/<peer-id>` in your browser to view the WebRTC stream:

> **Note:** You can control WebRTC frame overlays using `overlay` and `overlay-properties` in `destination.frame`.
>
> - If `"overlay": true`, `gvawatermark` is applied.
> - If `"overlay": false`, `gvawatermark` is not applied and `overlay-properties` is ignored.
> - If your pipeline in config.json already contains custom `gvawatermark` settings, use `"overlay": false` to avoid applying watermark twice.
>
> Example Webrtc frame destination with `overlay-properties`:
> ```json
> "frame": {
>     "type": "webrtc",
>     "peer-id": "pallet-defect-detection",
>     "overlay": true,
>     "overlay-properties": {
>         "font-scale": 1.5,
>         "draw-txt-bg": false,
>         "thickness": 3
>     }
> }
> ```

> **Note:** If you are using 4K or high resolution video make sure to increase the bitrate to
> avoid choppy video streaming. You can set the bitrate by adding `"bitrate" : 5000` with the
> WebRTC configurations in your Curl command.

- ```sh
    "frame": {
                    "type": "webrtc",
                    "peer-id": "pallet-defect-detection",
                    "bitrate": 5000
                }
    ```

> **Note:** MediaMTX may fail to stream if the pipeline initialization takes longer than 10
> seconds. To resolve this, you can increase the WHIP_SERVER_TIMEOUT value in the .env file
> located in the [WORKDIR]/edge-ai-libraries/microservices/dlstreamer-pipeline-server/docker/ directory.
