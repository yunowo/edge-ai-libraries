# Retriever microservice

Retrieve embeddings based on vector similarity. Usually be used in pair with a `dataprep` microservice.

## Overview
The Retrieval Microservice is designed to perform efficient vector-based searches using vector database such as Milvus. It provides a RESTful API for retrieving relevant results based on text queries and optional filters. This microservice is optimized for handling large-scale datasets and supports flexible query configurations.

Key Features:

-    Text-Based Image/Video Retrieval:

        Accepts text queries and retrieves the top-k most relevant results based on vector similarity.

        Supports optional filters to refine search results.

-    Integration with Milvus:

        Utilizes the Milvus vector database for efficient storage and retrieval of embeddings.

        Ensures high performance and scalability for large datasets.


**Programming Language:** Python


## How It Works

1.    Query Processing:

        The microservice accepts a text query and optional filters via the /v1/retrieval endpoint.

        The query is processed with an embedding model to generate embeddings and to retrieve embeddings from the Milvus database.

2.    Result Generation:

        The retrieved results include metadata, similarity scores, and unique identifiers.

        Results are returned in JSON format for easy integration with downstream applications.
        
#### Workflow:
1.    The embedding model generates text embeddings for input descriptions (e.g., "traffic jam").
2.    The search engine searches the vector database for the top-k most similar matches.
3.    Generate results with the matched vector ids and metadata.
