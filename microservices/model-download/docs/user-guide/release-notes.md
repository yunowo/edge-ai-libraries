# Release Notes: Model Download

## Version 2026.1.0

**June 17, 2026**

**New**

- Added a new Pipeline Zoo Models plugin for downloading models from the `dlstreamer/pipeline-zoo-models` repository.
- Added external source hubs for OpenVINO Model Zoo (`omz`) and allowlisted runtime archive downloads (`remote-url`).
- Isolated Python virtual environments per plugin to prevent dependency conflicts.
- Out-of-the-box support for the latest OpenVINO release (any version above 2025.4.1).
- Enabled TTS, STT, and image generation model types in the OpenVINO plugin.
- Introduced `--ovms-release-tag` option in `run_service.sh` to configure the OVMS release version (default: `v2025.4.1`).
- Resolved `Qwen/Qwen3-VL-8B` conversion failure when using a newer OpenVINO release tag.
- Upgraded the Ultralytics public model download script to DL Streamer v2026.0.0.
- Added Ultralytics INT8 quantization support through `config.quantize` and added relevant unit test cases.
- Added rejection of multi-model requests (`all`, `yolo_all`, and comma-separated model names) when `quantize` is set.
- Added cleanup when INT8 artifacts are not generated after user sends the INT8 request.
- Added ephemeral container support for one-shot downloads without impacting the existing download flow.
- Introduced a new script to enable the ephemeral download flow.
- Made HF token optional for model downloads.
- Added a quickstart guide for ephemeral mode.
- Added `POST /api/v1/models/list` to list models available from supported hubs before download. Listing is currently supported for `huggingface`, `ultralytics`, `pipeline-zoo-models`, and `geti`.

**Improved**

- API hub names are now accepted case-insensitively (e.g. `Geti`, `GETI`, and `HuggingFace` all map to their canonical lowercase identifier).
- `GET /api/v1/plugins` now reports model-listing capabilities and accepted listing filter fields.
- `microsoft/Phi3.5-mini-instruct` model conversion requires the default OpenVINO version (`v2025.4.1`); newer versions with `transformers>4.55` are not yet compatible.

**Known Issues**:

- Intel does not support Edge Manageability Framework deployment currently.
- Due to a limitation in the DL Streamer public model download script, all supported precision artifacts (for example, FP32 and FP16) are downloaded by default even when not requested. When INT8 is specifically requested by user, the other supported precision artifacts are still downloaded along with INT8.
