# Audio Analyzer Microservice

This repository provides a FastAPI-based microservice for audio transcription
and optional voice-sentiment analysis. It accepts an uploaded audio file,
chunks it with FFmpeg, runs ASR on each chunk, and returns either a single
transcription response, an OpenAI-compatible Server-Sent Events stream, or a
streaming NDJSON event stream. It also exposes an OpenAI Realtime-shaped
WebSocket endpoint (`/v1/realtime`) for continuous, live audio streaming,
where server-side voice activity detection segments the feed into utterances.
When sentiment is enabled, it also returns a session-level sentiment summary.

Below, you'll find links to detailed documentation to help you get started,
configure, and deploy the microservice.
