Scene Understanding Service is a generic microservice for multi-scene
behavioral analysis. It subscribes to
[Scenescape](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/scenescape) MQTT topics to
consume scene events and track objects across configured scenes and zones,
applies a declarative rule engine to interpret those events, and routes the
resulting alerts to a downstream alert service. Because all behavior is defined
through configuration rather than code, the service is not tied to any single
use case — suspicious activity detection (loitering, checkout bypass,
concealment, restricted-zone violations) is just one example, and the same
engine can power other scene-understanding scenarios. It is designed to be
dropped into any Scenescape-based deployment by supplying two YAML config
files — no code changes required.

## Use Cases

- Generic scene understanding: consume Scenescape events and apply declarative,
  zone-based behavioral rules for any domain.
- Retail loss prevention: loitering, repeated high-value-zone visits,
  checkout bypass, and concealment detection.
- Restricted-area monitoring: alert when an object enters a zone it should
  not be in.
- Any Scenescape deployment that needs declarative, zone-based behavioral
  rules with optional pose/VLM escalation.

## Key Capabilities

- Multi-scene, multi-camera object tracking driven entirely by Scenescape MQTT.
- Declarative YAML rule engine — thresholds and rules change without code edits.
- Optional behavioral-analysis escalation (pose + VLM) over MQTT.
- Zone auto-discovery from the Scenescape REST API at startup.
- Per-person session state machine (zone visits, dwell time, flags).
- Optional SeaweedFS evidence-frame capture and alert routing.
- Self-contained image: ships with sample config and runs standalone.

## Configuration Surface

All runtime behavior is driven by two YAML files mounted at `/app/configs`
(override with `CONFIG_DIR`):

- `scene-config.yaml` — Scenescape connection (MQTT + REST), scenes, cameras,
  and zones.
- `rules.yaml` — declarative rule definitions, thresholds, session flags, and
  escalation services.

See the [Configuration Guide](./get-started/configuration.md) for the full field list.
