# System Requirements

## Hardware Requirements

- **CPU**: x86_64. Intel Core Ultra (Meteor Lake) or newer is recommended.
  Older Intel Core / Xeon processors will run the service but may be slower
  when the optional behavioral-analysis path is enabled.
- **Memory**: 4 GB RAM minimum for the service itself. 8 GB or more is
  recommended when many concurrent person sessions are tracked.
- **Disk**: 5 GB free space for the image and logs. Evidence frames are stored
  in SeaweedFS (a separate service), not on the service's local disk.
- **GPU**: Not required by this service. The optional behavioral-analysis
  worker (pose + VLM) is a separate microservice that may use a GPU.

| Device | Minimum    | Recommended                             |
| ------ | ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| CPU    | x86_64     | Intel Core Ultra (Meteor Lake) or newer |
| Memory | 4 GB RAM   | 8 GB RAM or more                        |
| Disk   | 5 GB free  | SSD/NVMe                                |
| GPU    | Not needed | Used only by the separate BA worker     |

## Software Requirements

### Operating System

- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (validated) or a compatible Linux distribution.
- For container deployment: Docker Engine and Docker Compose v2.

### Python (Standalone Run)

- Python 3.11 or newer.
- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager (used to create the
  virtual environment and install dependencies from `pyproject.toml`).

## External Dependencies

The service is an event consumer/producer and depends on external
infrastructure at runtime:

| Dependency             | Required?             | Purpose                                 |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Scenescape MQTT broker | Yes (functional)      | Source of all person and zone events.   |
| Scenescape REST API    | Yes (functional)      | Zone auto-discovery (zone name → UUID). |
| SeaweedFS              | Only if BA rules used | Evidence frame storage for escalation.  |
| behavioral-analysis    | Only if BA rules used | Pose + VLM analysis over MQTT.          |
| alert-service          | Optional              | Routes/delivers generated alerts.       |

The service starts and serves its API even when these are unavailable; it
retries the MQTT connection in the background. It only produces meaningful
output once a Scenescape deployment is reachable.

## Network Requirements

- Outbound access to the Scenescape MQTT broker (default TCP `1883`, or `8883`
  with TLS) and the Scenescape REST API (HTTPS).
- Inbound access to TCP port `8082` (default) for API clients.
- When the optional features are enabled, network reachability to SeaweedFS,
  the behavioral-analysis worker (shared MQTT broker), and the alert-service.
