    - `graph` - Inline pipeline graph provided directly

    Used in DensityTestSpec to describe how streams are assigned to each
    pipeline. The schema supports two modes, selected automatically based
    on whether the optional `streams` field is provided:

    ## Modes

    ### Classic density (default)
    All specs omit `streams`. The benchmark searches for the maximum
    total stream count that still meets ``fps_floor`` and splits it
    between pipelines using ``stream_rate`` ratios (must sum to 100).

    ### Mixed density
    Exactly one of two specs sets `streams` to a fixed value. The
    pipeline with `streams` is pinned to that count; the other pipeline
    is the one the benchmark increments (using the same exponential +
    bisection search as classic density). ``stream_rate`` is ignored in
    this mode.

    ## Attributes
    - `pipeline` - Graph source (either a reference to existing variant or inline graph; discriminated by 'source' field: \"variant\" or \"graph\")
    - `stream_rate` - Relative share of total streams for this pipeline expressed as percentage (classic mode only; all stream_rate values must sum to 100)
    - `streams` - Fixed input stream count for this pipeline (mixed-density mode). When set on one of exactly two specs, the other spec is incremented by the benchmark algorithm.

    ### Example (Variant reference, classic mode)
    ```json
    {
      "pipeline": {
        "source": "variant",
        "pipeline_id": "pipeline-a3f5d9e1",
        "variant_id": "variant-abc123"

      "stream_rate": 50
    }

      },
      "stream_rate": 50
    }

class DensityTestSpec(BaseModel):
    """
    **Request body for starting a density test.**

    Supports two modes, selected automatically from the request shape
    (see ``PipelineDensitySpec`` for details):

    - **Classic density** — no spec sets ``streams``; the benchmark
      searches the total stream count and splits it across pipelines
      using ``stream_rate`` ratios (must sum to 100).
    - **Mixed density** — exactly two specs, exactly one with
      ``streams`` set; that pipeline is pinned to ``streams`` and the
      other pipeline is incremented by the same algorithm as classic
      density.

    ## Attributes
    - `fps_floor` - Minimum acceptable FPS per stream
    - `pipeline_density_specs` - List of pipelines. Carries `stream_rate` (classic mode) or `streams` (mixed mode) per spec.
    - `execution_config` - Configuration for output generation, metadata publishing and runtime limits

    Returned with HTTP 422 by `POST /images/upload` when the submitted
    archive fails any validation step (extension, size, layout, content,
    duplicate name, ...). Mirrors the shape of `VideoUploadError`: a
    human-readable `detail` plus a machine-readable `error` /
    `found` / `allowed` triple. The `found` and `allowed` fields are
    typed loosely (`Any` / `list[Any]`) because some checks return
    composite values such as a list of detected extensions or a pair of
    resolutions.
