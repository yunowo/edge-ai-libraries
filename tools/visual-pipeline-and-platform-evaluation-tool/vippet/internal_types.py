"""Internal dataclass types for pipeline test execution.

This module contains internal representations of API request types used by
managers and benchmark components. These types are converted from API schema
types (Pydantic models) in the route layer after validation.

The internal types contain resolved pipeline information (graphs, IDs, names)
rather than references, making them easier to work with in the execution layer.
