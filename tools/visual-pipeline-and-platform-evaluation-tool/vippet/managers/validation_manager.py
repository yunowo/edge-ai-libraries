    Thread-safe singleton that manages validation jobs using PipelineRunner to execute pipelines.

    Create instances with ValidationManager() to get the shared singleton instance.

    Responsibilities:

    * create and track :class:`InternalValidationJob` instances,
    * run validations asynchronously in background threads,
    * use :class:`PipelineRunner` in validation mode to execute pipelines,
    * expose job status and summaries in a thread-safe manner.

    All internal state uses Graph objects and internal types from internal_types.
