"""Score computation and aggregation for benchmark runs.

A benchmark score has three components:

- ``performance`` - raw throughput (total FPS).
- ``efficiency`` - throughput per unit of resource cost (FPS per Watt, or FPS
  per mean utilization percent when power is unavailable).
- ``total`` - the geometric mean of performance and efficiency, so a workload
  cannot mask a poor efficiency score with a large FPS number (or vice versa).

The same shape is used at every level: per test case, per workload (aggregating
its test cases) and per suite (aggregating its workloads).
