# Get Started

<!--
**Sample Description**: Provide a brief overview of the application and its purpose.
-->

The ChatQ&A Sample Application is a modular Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline designed to help developers create intelligent chatbots that can answer questions based on enterprise data. This guide will help you set up, run, and modify the ChatQ&A Sample Application on Intel Edge AI systems.

<!--
**What You Can Do**: Highlight the developer workflows supported by the guide.
-->

By following this guide, you will learn how to:

- **Set up the sample application**: Use Docker Compose to quickly deploy the application in your environment.
- **Run the application**: Execute the application to see real-time question answering based on your data.
- **Modify application parameters**: Customize settings like inference models and deployment configurations to adapt the application to your specific requirements.

## Prerequisites

- Verify that your system meets the [minimum requirements](./system-requirements.md).
- Install Docker: [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
- Install Docker Compose: [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
- Install `Python 3.11`.

<!--
**Setup and First Use**: Include installation instructions, basic operation, and initial validation.
-->

## Supported Models
All models - embedding, reranker, and LLM - which are supported by the chosen model serving can be used with this sample application. The models can be downloaded from popular model hubs like Hugging Face. Refer to respective model hub documentation for details on how to access and download models. 

The sample application has been validated with a few models just to validate the functionality. This list is only illustrative and the user is not limited to only these models.

### Embedding Models validated for each model server
   | Model Server | Models Validated |
   |--------------|-------------------|
   | `TEI` | `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5`, `BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5` |
   | `OVMS` | `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5`, `BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5` |

### LLM Models validated for each model server
| Model Server | Models Validated |
   |--------------|-------------------|
   | `vLLM` | `Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-3`, `Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct`, `microsoft/Phi-3.5-mini-instruct`, `meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-instruct`, `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B` |
   | `OVMS` | `Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-3`, `Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct`, `microsoft/Phi-3.5-mini-instruct`, `meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-instruct`, `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B` |
   | `TGI` | `Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-3`, `Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct`, `microsoft/Phi-3.5-mini-instruct`, `meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-instruct`, `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B` |

Note: Limited validation was done on DeepSeek model. 

### Reranker Models validated 
   | Model Server | Models Validated |
   |--------------|-------------------|
   | `TEI` | `BAAI/bge-reranker-base` |

### Getting access to models

To run a **GATED MODEL** like llama models, the user will need to pass their [huggingface token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens#user-access-tokens). The user will need to request access to specific model by going to the respective model page in HuggingFace.

Visit https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens to get your token.

## Running the application using Docker Compose

<!--
**User Story 1**: Setting Up the Application
- **As a developer**, I want to set up the application in my environment, so that I can start exploring its functionality.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Step-by-step instructions for downloading and installing the application.
2. Verification steps to ensure successful setup.
3. Troubleshooting tips for common installation issues.
-->

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone the repository.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries.git edge-ai-libraries
   ```
   Note: Adjust the repo link appropriately in case of forked repo.

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   Go to the directory where the Docker Compose file is located:

   ```bash
   cd edge-ai-libraries/sample-applications/chat-question-and-answer
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Set up the environment variables based on the inference method you plan to use:

   _Common configuration_

   ```bash
   export HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=<your-huggingface-token>
   export LLM_MODEL=Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-3
   export EMBEDDING_MODEL_NAME=BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5
   export RERANKER_MODEL=BAAI/bge-reranker-base
   export OTLP_ENDPOINT_TRACE=<otlp-endpoint-trace> # Optional. Set only if there is an OTLP endpoint available or can be ignored
   export OTLP_ENDPOINT=<otlp-endpoint> # Optional. Set only if there is an OTLP endpoint available or can be ignored
   ```
   Login using your Hugging Face token

   ```bash
   # Login using huggingface-cli
   pip install huggingface-hub
   huggingface-cli login
   # pass hugging face token
   ```

    _Environment variables for OVMS as inference_
    ```bash
    # Install required Python packages for model preparation
    export PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL="https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu"
    pip3 install optimum-intel@git+https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-intel.git openvino-tokenizers[transformers]==2024.4.* openvino==2024.4.* nncf==2.14.0 sentence_transformers==3.1.1 openai "transformers<4.45"
    ```
    
   _Run the below script to set up the rest of the environment depending on the model server and embedding._

   ```bash
   export REGISTRY="intel/"
   export TAG=1.1.2
   source setup.sh llm=<model-server> embed=<embedding>
   # Below are the options
   # model-server: VLLM , OVMS, TGI
   # embedding: OVMS, TEI
   ```

4. **Start the Application**:
   Start the application using Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```
   - Refer to the application architecture diagram [here](./overview-architecture.md#technical-architecture-diagram) .

5. **Verify the Application**:
   Check that the application is running:

   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

6. **Access the Application**:
   Open a browser and go to `http://<host-ip>:5173` to access the application dashboard. The application dashboard allows the user to,
    - Create and manage context by adding documents (pdf, docx, etc.) and web links. Note: There are restrictions on the max size of the document allowed.
    - Start Q&A session with the created context.
    

## Running in Kubernetes

Refer to [Deploy with Helm](./deploy-with-helm.md) for the details. Ensure the prerequisites mentioned on this page are addressed before proceeding to deploy with Helm.

## Running Tests

1. Ensure you have the necessary environment variables set up as mentioned in the setup section.

2. Run the tests using `pytest`:
   ```sh
   cd sample-applications/chat-question-and-answer/tests/unit_tests/
   poetry run pytest
   ```
