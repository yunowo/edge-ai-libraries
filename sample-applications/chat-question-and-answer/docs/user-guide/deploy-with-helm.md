# How to deploy with Helm

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the ChatQ&A Sample Application using Helm.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:
- Kubernetes cluster set up and running.
- The cluster must support **dynamic provisioning of Persistent Volumes (PV)**. Refer to the [Kubernetes Dynamic Provisioning Guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/dynamic-provisioning/) for more details.
- Install `kubectl` on your system. Refer to [Installation Guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/). Ensure access to the Kubernetes cluster.
- Helm installed on your system: [Installation Guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

## Steps to deploy with Helm

Following steps should be followed to deploy ChatQ&A using Helm. You can install from source code or pull the chart from Docker hub.

**_Steps 1 to 3 varies depending on if the user prefers to build or pull the Helm details._**

### Option 1: Install from Docker Hub

#### Step 1: Pull the Specific Chart

Use the following command to pull the Helm chart from Docker Hub:
```bash
helm pull oci://registry-1.docker.io/intel/chat-question-and-answer --version <version-no>
```

Refer to the release notes for details on the latest version number to use for the sample application.

#### Step 2: Extract the `.tgz` File

After pulling the chart, extract the `.tgz` file:
```bash
tar -xvf chat-question-and-answer-<version-no>.tgz
```

This will create a directory named `chat-question-and-answer` containing the chart files. Navigate to the extracted directory. 
```bash
cd chat-question-and-answer
```

#### Step 3: Configure the `values.yaml` File

Choose the appropriate `values*.yaml` file based on the model server you want to use:

- **For OVMS**: Use `values_ovms.yaml`.
- **For vLLM**: Use `values_vllm.yaml`.
- **For TGI**: Use `values_tgi.yaml`.

Edit only the `values.yaml` file to set the necessary environment variables. Ensure you set the `huggingface.apiToken` and proxy settings as required.

| Key | Description | Example Value |
| --- | ----------- | ------------- |
| `global.huggingface.apiToken` | Your Hugging Face API token                      | `<your-huggingface-token>` |

| `global.POSTGRES_PASSWORD`  | Give pwd for PG Vector DB | `<your-postgres-password>` |
| `global.MINIO_ROOT_USER`   | A Minio server user name | `<your-minio-user-id>` (user length should be at least 3) |
| `global.MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD`| A password to connect to minio server | `<your-minio-password>` (password length should be at least 8 characters) |
| `global.OTLP_ENDPOINT` | OTLP endpoint | |
| `global.OTLP_ENDPOINT_TRACE` | OTLP endpoint for trace | |
| `global.teiEmbeddingService.enabled` | Flag to enable TEI embedding model server | `false` |
| `global.ovmsEmbeddingService.enabled` | Flag to enable OVMS embedding model server | `true` |
| `global.UI_NODEPORT` | Sets the static port (in the 30000–32767 range) | |
| `global.keeppvc` | Set true to persists the storage. Default is false | false |
| `global.ovmsEmbeddinggpuService.enabled` | To Enable OVMS Embedding on GPU | false |
| `global.GPU.enabled` | For model server deployed on GPU | false |
| `global.GPU.key` | Label assigned to the GPU node on kubernetes cluster by the device plugin example- gpu.intel.com/i915, gpu.intel.com/xe. Identify by running kubectl describe node <gpu-node> | `<your-node-key-on-cluster>` |
| `global.GPU.device` | Default is GPU, If the system has an integrated GPU, its id is always 0 (GPU.0). The GPU is an alias for GPU.0. If a system has multiple GPUs (for example, an integrated and a discrete Intel GPU) It is done by specifying GPU.1,GPU.0 | GPU |
| `Chatqna.name` | Name of the ChatQnA application                        | `chatqna` |
| `Chatqna.image.repository` | image repository url                | `intel/chatqna` |
| `Chatqna.image.tag` | latest image tag                                  | `1.2.1`   |
| `Chatqna.env.ENDPOINT_URL` | connection endpoint to model server |              |
| `Chatqna.env.INDEX_NAME` | index name for pgVector                      | `intel-rag` |
| `Chatqna.env.FETCH_K` |  Number of top K results to fetch               | `10` |
| `Chatqna.global.EMBEDDING_MODEL_NAME`|   embedding model name                        | `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5`|
| `Chatqna.env.PG_CONNECTION_STRING` |    pgvector connection string      | `postgresql+psycopg://`|
| `Chatqna.env.LLM_MODEL` |  model to be used with tgi/vllm/ovms               | `Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-3`|
| `Chatqna.env.RERANKER_MODEL` |  model to be used with tei               | `BAAI/bge-reranker-base`|

NOTE: GPU is only enabled for openvino model server (OVMS)

### Option 2: Install from Source

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository containing the Helm chart:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

#### Step 2: Change to the Chart Directory

Navigate to the chart directory:
```bash
cd <repository-url>/sample-applications/chat-question-and-answer/chart
```

#### Step 3: Configure the `values.yaml` File

Edit the `values.yaml` file located in the chart directory to set the necessary environment variables. Refer to the table in **Option 1, Step 3** for the list of keys and example values.


#### Step 4: Build Helm Dependencies

Navigate to the chart directory and build the Helm dependencies using the following command:

```bash
helm dependency build
```
## Common Steps after configuration

### Step 5: Deploy the Helm Chart

Deploy the OVMS Helm chart:

```bash
helm install chatqna . -f values_ovms.yaml -n <your-namespace>
```
**Note:** When deploying OVMS, the OVMS service is observed to take more time than other model serving due to model conversion time.

Deploy the vLLM Helm chart:

```bash
helm install chatqna . -f values_vllm.yaml -n <your-namespace>
```

Deploy the TGI Helm chart:

```bash
helm install chatqna . -f values_tgi.yaml -n <your-namespace>
```

### Step 6: Verify the Deployment

Check the status of the deployed resources to ensure everything is running correctly

```bash
kubectl get pods -n <your-namespace>
kubectl get services -n <your-namespace>
```

### Step 7: Access the Application 

Open the UI in a browser at http://\<node-ip\>:\<ui-node-port\>

### Step 8: Update Helm Dependencies

If any changes are made to the subcharts, update the Helm dependencies using the following command:

```bash
helm dependency update
```
### Step 9: Uninstall Helm chart

To uninstall helm charts deployed, use the following command:

```bash
helm uninstall <name> -n <your-namespace>
```

## Verification

- Ensure that all pods are running and the services are accessible.
- Access the application dashboard and verify that it is functioning as expected.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues during the deployment process, check the Kubernetes logs for errors:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs <pod-name>
  ```
- The _PVC_ created during helm chart deployment will remain present until explicitly deleted, use the below command to delete:
  ```bash
  kubectl delete pvc <pvc-name> -n <namespace>
  ```
