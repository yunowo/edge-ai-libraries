# How to deploy with Helm

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the Document Summarization Sample Application using Helm.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:
- Kubernetes cluster set up and running.
- The cluster must support **dynamic provisioning of Persistent Volumes (PV)**. Refer to the [Kubernetes Dynamic Provisioning Guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/dynamic-provisioning/) for more details.
- Install `kubectl` on your system. Refer to [Installation Guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/). Ensure access to the Kubernetes cluster.
- Helm installed on your system: [Installation Guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

## Steps to deploy with Helm

Following steps should be followed to deploy Document Summarization application using Helm. You can install from source code or pull the chart from Docker hub.

**_Steps 1 to 3 varies depending on if the user prefers to build or pull the Helm details._**

### Option 1: Install from Docker Hub

#### Step 1: Pull the Specific Chart

Use the following command to pull the Helm chart from Docker Hub:
```bash
helm pull oci://registry-1.docker.io/intel/document-summarization --version <version-no>
```

Refer to the release notes for details on the latest version number to use for the sample application.

#### Step 2: Extract the `.tgz` File

After pulling the chart, extract the `.tgz` file:
```bash
tar -xvf document-summarization-<version-no>.tgz
```

This will create a directory named `document-summarization` containing the chart files. Navigate to the extracted directory. 
```bash
cd document-summarization
```

#### Step 3: Configure the `values.yaml` File

Edit the selected `values*.yaml` file to set the necessary environment variables. Ensure you set the proxy settings as required.

| Key | Description | Example Value |
| --- | ----------- | ------------- |
| `global.proxy.noProxy` | NOPROXY | `<your-no-proxy>, docker service names` |
| `global.proxy.httpProxy` | HTTP PROXY | `<your-http-proxy>` |
| `global.proxy.httpsProxy` | HTTPS PROXY | `<your-https-proxy>` |
| `global.huggingface.token` | Your Hugging Face API token | `<your-huggingface-token` |
| `global.ui.nodePort` | Sets the static port (in the 30000–32767 range) | |
| `global.otlp` | OTLP Endpoint | `<your-otlp-endpoint>` |
| `global.llm.llmModelId` | Model to be used with ovms | Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-3 or microsoft/Phi-3.5-mini-instruct |


### Option 2: Install from Source

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository containing the Helm chart:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

#### Step 2: Change to the Chart Directory

Navigate to the chart directory:
```bash
cd <repository-url>/sample-applications/document-summarization/chart
```

#### Step 3: Configure the `values*.yaml` File

Edit the `values*.yaml` file located in the chart directory to set the necessary environment variables. Refer to the table in **Option 1, Step 3** for the list of keys and example values.


#### Step 4: Build Helm Dependencies

Navigate to the chart directory and build the Helm dependencies using the following command:

```bash
helm dependency build
```
## Common Steps after configuration

### Step 5: Deploy the Helm Chart

Deploy the OVMS Helm chart:

```bash
helm install document-summarization . -n <your-namespace>
```
**Note:** When deploying OVMS, the OVMS service is observed to take more time than other model serving due to model conversion time.

### Step 6: Verify the Deployment

Check the status of the deployed resources to ensure everything is running correctly

```bash
kubectl get pods -n <your-namespace>
kubectl get services -n <your-namespace>
```

### Step 7: Retrieving the Service Endpoint (NodePort and NodeIP)

To access a docsum-nginx service running in your Kubernetes cluster using NodePort, you need to retrieve:

- NodeIP – The internal IP of a worker node.
- NodePort – The port exposed by the service.

Run the following command after replacing \<ui-node-port\> with your actual values:
```bash
  kubectl get nodes -o wide | awk '$2 == "Ready" {print $6 ":<ui-node-port>"; exit}'
```
Simply copy and paste the output into your browser.

### Step 8: Update Helm Dependencies

If any changes are made to the subcharts, update the Helm dependencies using the following command:

```bash
helm dependency update
```
### Step 9: Uninstall Helm chart

To uninstall helm charts deployed, use the following command:

```bash
helm uninstall document-summarization -n <your-namespace>
```

## Verification

- Ensure that all pods are running and the services are accessible.
- Access the application dashboard and verify that it is functioning as expected.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues during the deployment process, check the Kubernetes logs for errors:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs <pod-name>
  ```
- The _PVC_ created during helm chart deployment will remain present until explicitly deleted, use the below command to delete:
  ```bash
  kubectl delete pvc <pvc-name> -n <namespace>
  ```
